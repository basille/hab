This is the development area for the package `hab`, a set of functions related
to habitat selection and movement analyses. Also includes a few patches for
functions from the adehabitat package family (notably
[adehabitatLT](https://cran.r-project.org/package=adehabitatLT) and
[adehabitatHR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=adehabitatHR)).

## Installation

You can use the [`remotes`](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package to install the
latest version:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("basille/hab")
```

## Getting started

For a list of documented functions, use `library(help = "hab")` or see the
Reference manual.
